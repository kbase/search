# This is a very client centric view of release engineering.
# We assume our primary product for the community is the client
# libraries,a command line interfaces, and the related documentation
# from which specific science applications can be built.
#
# A service is composed of a client and a server, each of which
# should be independently deployable. Clients are composed of
# an application programming interface and a command line
# interface. In our make targets, the deploy-service deploys
# the server, the deploy-client deploys the application
# programming interface libraries, and the deploy-scripts deploys
# the command line interface (usually scripts written in a
# scripting language but java executables also qualify), and the
# deploy target would be equivelant to deploying a service (client
# libs, scripts, and server).
#
# Because the deployment of the server side code depends on the
# specific software module being deployed, the strategy needs
# to be one that leaves this decision to the module developer.
# This is done by having the deploy target depend on the
# deploy-service target. The module developer who chooses for
# good reason not to deploy the server with the client simply
# manages this dependancy accordingly. One option is to have
# a deploy-service target that does nothing, the other is to
# remove the dependancy from the deploy target.
#
# A smiliar naming convention is used for tests.

# What does it mean to test a client. This is a test of a client
# library. If it is a client-server module, then it should be
# run against a running server. You can say that this also tests
# the server, and I agree. You can add a test-service dependancy
# to the test-client target if it makes sense to you. This test
# example assumes there is already a tested running server.

# What does it mean to test a script? A script test should test
# the command line scripts. If the script is a client in a client-
# server architecture, then there should be tests against a 
# running server. You can add a test-service dependancy to the
# test-client target. You could also add a deploy-service and
# start-server dependancy to the test-scripts target if it makes
# sense to you. Future versions of the make files for services
# will move in this direction.
test-scripts:

# What does it mean to test a server. A server test should not
# rely on the client libraries or scripts in so far as you should
# not have a test-service target that depends on the test-client
# or test-scripts targets. Otherwise, a circular dependency
# graph could result.

# Deployment:
# 
# We are assuming our primary product to the community are
# client side application programming interface libraries and
# command line interface (scripts). The deployment of client
# artifacts should not be dependent on deployment of a server,
# although we recommend deploying the server code with the
# client code when the deploy target is executed. If you have
# good reason not to deploy the server at the same time as the
# client, just delete the dependancy on deploy-service. It is
# important to note that you must have a deploy-service target
# even if there is no server side code to deploy.
#

# by default deploy only the service code

# be replaced by the deploy target.

# The deploy-libs and deploy-scripts targets are used to recognize

# implement an application programming interface and a set of 
# command line scripts that provide command based execution of
# individual api functions and aggregated sets of api functions.

# Deploying scripts needs some special care. They need to run
# in a certain runtime environment. Users should not have
# to modify their user environments to run kbase scripts other
# than just sourcing a single user-env script. The creation
# of this user-env script is the responsibility of the code
# that builds all the kbase modules. In the code below, we
# run a script in the dev_container tools directory that 
# wraps perl scripts. The name of the perl wrapper script is
# kept in the WRAP_PERL_SCRIPT make variable. This script
# requires some information that is passed to it by way
# of exported environment variables in the bash script below.
#
# What does it mean to wrap a perl script? To wrap a perl
# script means that a bash script is created that sets
# all required envirnment variables and then calls the perl
# script using the perl interperter in the kbase runtime.
# For this to work, both the actual script and the newly 
# created shell script have to be deployed. When a perl
# script is wrapped, it is first copied to TARGET/plbin.
# The shell script can now be created because the necessary
# environment variables are known and the location of the
# script is known.

# Deploying a service refers to the code that implements the logic

# be thought of as the code that is deployed on a server (server-side code).
# This target should include the creation of a start and stop server script.
# The start server script needs to know the service port and needs

compile-docs: build-libs

# Build libs should be dependent on the type specification and the

# need to put automatically generated code in a source code version
# control repository (ie cvs, git). It also ensures that you always
# have the most  up-to-date libs and documentation if your compile
# docs depends on the compiled libs.
